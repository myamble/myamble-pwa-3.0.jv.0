-- User Activity Logs Table
CREATE TABLE user_activity_logs (
    id UUID DEFAULT generateUUIDv4(),
    user_id UUID,
    event_type String,
    event_data String,
    created_at DateTime DEFAULT now()
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (user_id, created_at);

-- Indexes for faster queries
ALTER TABLE user_activity_logs ADD INDEX idx_user_id user_id TYPE minmax GRANULARITY 8192;
ALTER TABLE user_activity_logs ADD INDEX idx_event_type event_type TYPE set(10) GRANULARITY 8192;
```

**Prompt Details:**

1. **Table Name**: `user_activity_logs`
2. **Columns**:
   - `id`: A unique UUID for each log entry.
   - `user_id`: The ID of the user associated with the activity log.
   - `event_type`: A string representing the type of event being logged (e.g., "login", "survey_created", "response_submitted").
   - `event_data`: A string containing any additional data related to the event, stored as JSON.
   - `created_at`: A DateTime column storing the timestamp of when the event occurred, defaulting to the current time.
3. **Database Engine**: The table uses the `MergeTree` engine, which is optimized for high-performance analytics queries on large datasets.
4. **Sorting Key**: The table is sorted by `(user_id, created_at)`, allowing for efficient querying of user activity logs by user and time range.
5. **Indexes**:
   - `idx_user_id`: A minmax index on the `user_id` column for faster filtering and aggregation by user.
   - `idx_event_type`: A set index on the `event_type` column for efficient filtering and aggregation by event type.

**Considerations:**

1. **Data Retention**: Depending on the application's requirements, you may want to implement a data retention policy for the `user_activity_logs` table, either by setting a TTL (Time-To-Live) or periodically archiving or deleting old data.
2. **Partitioning**: For very large datasets, you may consider partitioning the table by a specific column (e.g., `toYYYYMM(created_at)`) to improve query performance and optimize data storage.
3. **Security**: Ensure that only authorized users or services can access and write to the `user_activity_logs` table, as it may contain sensitive information.
4. **Event Data Format**: The `event_data` column is designed to store JSON data, allowing for flexible storage of additional event-specific information. You may want to define a consistent schema or structure for the JSON data to facilitate querying and analysis.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement proper logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the performance and health of the `user_activity_logs` table, as well as any issues or errors that may occur during data ingestion or querying.

By following this schema design, you can efficiently store and query user activity logs in ClickHouse, enabling performance analysis, auditing, and other analytical use cases related to user behavior and system events.
