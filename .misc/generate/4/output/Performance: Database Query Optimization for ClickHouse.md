**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **ClickHouse Client Setup**: The code sets up a ClickHouse client instance using the `clickhouse` library. The connection details are read from environment variables for security and flexibility.

2. **Query Optimization Function**: The `optimizeQuery` function takes a SQL query as input and returns an optimized version of the query. It follows these steps:
   - Analyze the query plan using the `EXPLAIN PIPELINE` statement to identify potential optimizations.
   - Apply optimization rules based on the query plan:
     - Use pre-aggregated data from materialized views if the query involves a `MergeJoin` operation.
     - Move filter conditions early in the query pipeline to reduce the amount of data processed.
     - Utilize indexes for efficient filtering and sorting operations.
   - Additional optimization rules can be added as needed.

3. **Filter Condition Extraction**: The `extractFilterCondition` helper function extracts the filter condition from a SQL query by matching the `WHERE` clause.

4. **Example Usage**: The code demonstrates how to use the `optimizeQuery` function with a sample query. It optimizes the query based on the implemented rules and executes it against the ClickHouse database, logging the result.

**Considerations:**

- **Query Complexity**: The provided optimization rules are basic examples. In a production environment, you may need to implement more advanced optimization techniques based on the complexity of your queries and the specific requirements of your application.

- **Query Plan Analysis**: The code uses the `EXPLAIN PIPELINE` statement to analyze the query plan. You may need to adjust this approach based on the version of ClickHouse you are using and the available query plan analysis tools.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance monitoring and profiling mechanisms to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization in your queries. This will help you refine and add new optimization rules as needed.

- **Caching**: Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently executed queries or query results to further improve performance.

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the optimized queries to ensure they produce the same results as the original queries and do not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior.

- **Documentation**: Document the optimization rules and techniques used, as well as any assumptions or limitations, to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.

By following this approach, you can optimize queries in ClickHouse for efficient analytics processing, improving the performance and scalability of your Social Work Survey Application.
