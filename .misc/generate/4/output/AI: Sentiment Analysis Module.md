```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';
import { authenticateToken, checkPermission } from '../middleware/auth';
import { SentimentAnalysis } from './sentimentAnalysis';

const app = express.Router();

// Endpoint: Sentiment Analysis
app.post('/analytics/sentiment', authenticateToken, checkPermission('VIEW_ANALYTICS'), [
  body('surveyId').isUUID(),
  body('questionIds').isArray(),
], async (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }

  const { surveyId, questionIds } = req.body;

  try {
    const sentimentAnalysis = new SentimentAnalysis();
    const result = await sentimentAnalysis.analyze(surveyId, questionIds);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {

```

**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **Import Dependencies**: Import the required dependencies, including Express.js, express-validator for input validation, authentication middleware functions, and the `SentimentAnalysis` module.

2. **Endpoint: Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Route: `POST /analytics/sentiment`
   - Authentication: Requires a valid JWT token and the `VIEW_ANALYTICS` permission.
   - Input Validation: Validates the `surveyId` (UUID) and `questionIds` (array) using express-validator.
   - Request Body: `{ surveyId: string, questionIds: string[] }`
   - Functionality: Performs sentiment analysis on the open-ended responses for the specified survey questions. The `SentimentAnalysis` class is responsible for executing the sentiment analysis and returning the results.
   - Response: Returns the sentiment analysis results as JSON.

3. **SentimentAnalysis Class**:
   - This class should encapsulate the logic for performing sentiment analysis on open-ended survey responses.
   - The `analyze` method should accept the `surveyId` and `questionIds` as input parameters.
   - The class should retrieve the relevant open-ended responses from the database or data store.
   - Implement sentiment analysis techniques, such as using pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models or leveraging third-party sentiment analysis APIs.
   - The sentiment analysis should classify the responses into categories like positive, negative, neutral, or any other relevant sentiment categories.
   - The class should return the sentiment analysis results, which could include the sentiment scores or classifications for each response, as well as aggregated statistics or visualizations.

**Considerations:**

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Permissions**: Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform sentiment analysis.
- **NLP Model Selection**: Explore and evaluate different pre-trained NLP models or third-party sentiment analysis APIs to find the most suitable solution for your use case.
- **Multilingual Support**: If your application supports multiple languages, consider implementing language detection and using language-specific sentiment analysis models or APIs.
- **Performance Optimization**: Sentiment analysis can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Implement caching mechanisms, batch processing, or distributed computing strategies to improve performance.
- **Data Privacy and Compliance**: Ensure that the sentiment analysis process complies with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, if applicable to your use case.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for the sentiment analysis endpoint to track performance, errors, and potential issues.
- **Documentation**: Document the API endpoint, including input parameters, expected responses, and any specific requirements or constraints.

By implementing this sentiment analysis module, the Social Work Survey Application will gain the ability to analyze open-ended survey responses and extract valuable insights into the sentiments and opinions expressed by participants. This feature can provide social workers and researchers with a deeper understanding of qualitative data, enabling them to make more informed decisions and tailor their interventions or strategies accordingly.
