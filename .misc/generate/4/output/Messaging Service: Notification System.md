**Prompt:**

Implement a system for sending and managing various types of notifications, including real-time notifications, email notifications, and push notifications. The system should support the following features:

1. **Create Notifications**: Provide an API endpoint to create new notifications for users. The endpoint should accept the following parameters:
   - `type` (required): The type of notification (e.g., 'message', 'survey_response', 'system').
   - `data` (required): Additional data related to the notification, such as message content, survey details, or system event information.

2. **Get Unread Notifications**: Implement an API endpoint to retrieve a user's unread notifications. The endpoint should return a paginated list of unread notifications, sorted by creation time in descending order.

3. **Mark Notification as Read**: Provide an API endpoint to mark a specific notification as read for a user.

4. **Real-time Notifications**: Integrate with the existing WebSocket implementation to send real-time notifications to connected clients. When a new notification is created, it should be broadcasted to the appropriate user(s) in real-time.

5. **Email Notifications**: Implement a mechanism to send email notifications for specific types of notifications (e.g., survey response, system events). Integrate with a third-party email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) to handle email delivery.

6. **Push Notifications**: Implement support for sending push notifications to mobile devices. Integrate with a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification Service) to handle push notification delivery.

7. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to configure their notification preferences, such as enabling/disabling specific notification types or setting delivery channels (e.g., real-time, email, push).

8. **Notification Templates**: Implement a system for defining and managing notification templates. Templates should support placeholders for dynamic data and allow for customization based on notification type and user preferences.

9. **Notification Scheduling**: Provide the ability to schedule notifications for future delivery. This could be useful for sending reminders or announcements at specific times.

10. **Notification Tracking and Analytics**: Implement mechanisms to track notification delivery and user engagement (e.g., open rates, click-through rates). Integrate with an analytics service to provide insights into notification performance.

**Dependencies:**

- MongoDB Database Schema: Messages and Notifications (provided in the prompt)

**Considerations:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that users can only access and manage their own notifications. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

3. **Real-time Communication**: Leverage the existing WebSocket implementation to enable real-time notifications.

4. **Third-party Integrations**: Integrate with third-party services for email delivery (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification Service).

5. **Notification Templates**: Design a flexible and extensible system for defining and managing notification templates. Consider using a template engine or a dedicated template management service.

6. **Notification Preferences**: Implement a user-friendly interface for users to manage their notification preferences. Store and retrieve these preferences securely.

7. **Notification Scheduling**: Implement a scheduling mechanism using a task queue or a dedicated scheduling service (e.g., Cron, Celery, RabbitMQ).

8. **Notification Tracking and Analytics**: Implement mechanisms to track notification delivery and user engagement. Consider integrating with an analytics service or building custom analytics functionality.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure reliable operation and easy troubleshooting.

10. **Scalability and Performance**: Design the notification system with scalability and performance in mind. Consider implementing caching, load balancing, and other performance optimization techniques as needed.

11. **Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, data models, and any assumptions or constraints related to the notification system. Provide clear guidelines for integrating and using the notification system in other parts of the application.

By following this prompt, you will create a comprehensive notification system that supports real-time, email, and push notifications, as well as various features like notification preferences, templates, scheduling, and analytics. The system will be integrated with the existing messaging infrastructure and leverage third-party services for email and push notification delivery.
