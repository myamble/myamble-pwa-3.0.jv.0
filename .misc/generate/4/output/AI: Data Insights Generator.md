**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **Import Dependencies**: Import the required dependencies, including the Anthropic SDK for interacting with the Claude AI model and the E2B Code Interpreter for executing Python code.

2. **Initialize Anthropic and Code Interpreter**: Set up the Anthropic client with the API key and specify the Claude model to use (`claude-3-opus-20240229`). Also, create an instance of the Code Interpreter for executing Python code.

3. **Define System Prompt**: Set the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to provide context to the AI model about its role as a data scientist specializing in social work research. This prompt will be used for all subsequent queries.

4. **generateInsights Function**:
   - This function takes the survey data and a user-provided query as input.
   - It creates a message for the Anthropic API, including the system prompt, the user query, and the survey data.
   - It also configures a tool for executing Python code within the AI's response.
   - If the AI's response includes a tool use for executing Python code, the function executes the provided code using the Code Interpreter.
   - The function returns an object containing the AI-generated text insights and, if applicable, a base64-encoded PNG visualization generated by the Python code.

5. **Example Usage**: The provided example demonstrates how to use the `generateInsights` function. It passes in sample survey data and a query to generate a scatter plot showing the correlation between age and satisfaction scores. The function's output, including the text insights and visualization (if any), is logged to the console.

**Considerations:**

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the survey data and user query are properly validated and sanitized before passing them to the AI model.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures during the AI interaction or code execution processes.
- **Caching**: Consider caching the AI-generated insights and visualizations for frequently asked queries to improve performance.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for the insights generation process to track performance, errors, and potential issues.
- **Scalability**: As the data volume grows, consider implementing distributed computing or leveraging ClickHouse's capabilities for efficient data processing and analysis at scale.
- **Security**: Ensure that the AI model and the Code Interpreter are properly sandboxed and secured to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Ethics and Bias**: Continuously monitor and evaluate the AI-generated insights for potential biases or ethical concerns, especially in the context of social work research.
- **Documentation**: Document the usage of the `generateInsights` function, including input parameters, expected outputs, and any specific requirements or constraints.

By following this prompt, you can implement an AI-powered data insights generator that leverages the Claude AI model and the E2B Code Interpreter to provide advanced analysis and visualization capabilities for the Social Work Survey Application. This feature will enable social workers and researchers to gain deeper insights into survey data through natural language queries and AI-generated visualizations.
