**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **Import Dependencies**: Import the required dependencies, including the ClickHouse client library, express-validator for input validation, and authentication middleware functions.

2. **Initialize ClickHouse Client**: Create a new instance of the ClickHouse client with the appropriate connection configuration.

3. **Endpoint: Query Survey Analytics**:
   - Route: `POST /analytics/query`
   - Authentication: Requires a valid JWT token and the `VIEW_ANALYTICS` permission.
   - Input Validation: Validates the `surveyId` (UUID) and `query` (non-empty string) using express-validator.
   - Request Body: `{ surveyId: string, query: string }`
   - Functionality: Executes a basic query against the `survey_analytics` table to retrieve the response count grouped by survey ID, question ID, and answer. Additional filters and aggregations can be added based on the provided `query` string.
   - Response: Returns the query result as JSON.

4. **Endpoint: Get Pre-aggregated Analytics Summary**:
   - Route: `GET /analytics/summary/:surveyId`
   - Authentication: Requires a valid JWT token and the `VIEW_ANALYTICS` permission.
   - Request Parameter: `surveyId` (UUID)
   - Functionality: Queries the `survey_analytics_summary` materialized view to retrieve pre-aggregated analytics data for the specified `surveyId`. This view provides a summary of response counts grouped by survey ID, question ID, and answer.
   - Response: Returns the pre-aggregated analytics summary as JSON.

5. **Endpoint: Get Basic Survey Statistics**:
   - Route: `GET /analytics/statistics/:surveyId`
   - Authentication: Requires a valid JWT token and the `VIEW_ANALYTICS` permission.
   - Request Parameter: `surveyId` (UUID)
   - Functionality: Queries the `survey_analytics` table to retrieve basic statistics for the specified `surveyId`, including the total number of responses and the response count for each question.
   - Response: Returns an object containing the total response count and an array of response counts grouped by question ID.

6. **Error Handling**: Each endpoint includes error handling and logging for potential failures during query execution or data fetching.

**Considerations:**

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Permissions**: Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access and query the analytics data.
- **Query Optimization**: As the data volume grows, you may need to optimize the queries and leverage ClickHouse's features for efficient querying, such as indexing, partitioning, and materialized views.
- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed or computationally expensive analytics queries to improve performance.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for the analytics endpoints to track performance, errors, and potential issues.
- **Pagination and Limiting**: For endpoints that may return large result sets, consider implementing pagination or limiting the number of results returned to prevent excessive memory usage or network overhead.
- **Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, including input parameters, expected responses, and any specific requirements or constraints.

By following this prompt, you can implement basic statistical analysis endpoints for querying and analyzing survey data stored in ClickHouse. These endpoints provide a foundation for more advanced analytics capabilities, such as data visualization, trend analysis, and AI-powered insights.
