## Component Description

1. **Frontend SPA**: A React.js based single-page application using Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance.
2. **API Gateway**: An Express.js server that handles routing, authentication, and load balancing for microservices.
3. **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
4. **Survey Service**: Handles survey creation, editing, and response collection.
5. **Analytics Service**: Provides AI-powered data analysis and visualization capabilities.
6. **Messaging Service**: Manages real-time communication between users.
7. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between microservices.
8. **Databases**:
   - PostgreSQL for structured data (users and surveys)
   - ClickHouse for high-performance analytics storage
   - MongoDB for flexible document storage (messages and attachments)

## Microservices Communication

The microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs and asynchronous messaging using RabbitMQ. The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice and handling authentication and load balancing.

## Data Flow

1. The Frontend SPA communicates with the API Gateway to fetch data and initiate actions.
2. The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on the requested resource.
3. Microservices interact with their respective databases to read and write data.
4. Asynchronous events and notifications are published to the Message Queue by microservices.
5. Microservices subscribe to relevant events from the Message Queue and perform necessary actions.

## Security

Security is a top priority in the system architecture. The following measures are implemented:

- Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting and security headers to mitigate common web vulnerabilities
- Secure communication channels using HTTPS

## Scalability and High Availability

The microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of individual services based on demand. Load balancing and failover mechanisms ensure high availability and fault tolerance. The system can be deployed in a containerized environment using Docker and Kubernetes for efficient scaling and orchestration.

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining system health and troubleshooting issues. Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring system metrics, while structured logging with Winston provides detailed logs for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Deployment and DevOps

The application is designed for containerized deployment using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. A CI/CD pipeline is implemented using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing, building, and deployment to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

This architecture overview provides a high-level understanding of the system's components, their interactions, and the design principles followed. Detailed documentation for each component, including API specifications, database schemas, and development guidelines, is available in the respective sections of the project documentation.
