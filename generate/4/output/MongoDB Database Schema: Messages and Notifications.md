```typescript
// Message Schema
const messageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  senderId: { type: String, required: true },
  receiverId: { type: String, required: true },
  content: { type: String, required: true },
  roomId: { type: String, required: true },
  attachments: [{
    filename: String,
    fileUrl: String,
    fileType: String
  }],
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

// Indexing for efficient querying
messageSchema.index({ roomId: 1, createdAt: -1 });

const Message = mongoose.model('Message', messageSchema);

// Notification Schema
const notificationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  userId: { type: String, required: true },
  type: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['message', 'survey_response', 'system'] },
  data: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed },
  isRead: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

// Indexing for efficient querying
notificationSchema.index({ userId: 1, isRead: 1, createdAt: -1 });

const Notification = mongoose.model('Notification', notificationSchema);
```

**Considerations:**

1. **Message Schema**:
   - The `senderId` and `receiverId` fields store the user IDs of the sender and receiver, respectively.
   - The `content` field stores the message text.
   - The `roomId` field represents the unique identifier for the chat room or conversation.
   - The `attachments` field is an array that can store metadata for any file attachments, such as filename, file URL, and file type.
   - The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields store the creation and update timestamps for the message.
   - An index is created on the `roomId` and `createdAt` fields to optimize queries for retrieving messages in a specific room, ordered by creation time.

2. **Notification Schema**:
   - The `userId` field stores the user ID for whom the notification is intended.
   - The `type` field represents the type of notification (e.g., 'message', 'survey_response', 'system').
   - The `data` field is a flexible field that can store any additional data related to the notification, such as message content, survey details, or system event information.
   - The `isRead` field tracks whether the notification has been read by the user.
   - The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields store the creation and update timestamps for the notification.
   - An index is created on the `userId`, `isRead`, and `createdAt` fields to optimize queries for retrieving notifications for a specific user, filtered by read status and ordered by creation time.

3. **Real-time Operations**:
   - The schemas are designed to support real-time operations, such as retrieving the latest messages in a chat room or displaying unread notifications for a user.
   - The indexing strategies ensure efficient querying for common operations, such as fetching messages or notifications based on specific criteria.

4. **Security**:
   - Sensitive data, such as message content or notification details, should be encrypted before storing in the database.
   - Access control mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that users can only access messages and notifications intended for them.

5. **Performance**:
   - Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data, such as recent messages or unread notification counts.
   - Regularly monitor and optimize database performance, including indexing strategies and query optimization.

6. **Scalability**:
   - MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities can be leveraged to handle increasing data volumes and traffic as the application grows.
   - Consider implementing sharding or replication strategies for improved performance and availability.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the schema definitions, indexing strategies, and any assumptions or constraints related to the data models.
   - Provide clear guidelines for interacting with the message and notification data, including best practices for querying, updating, and deleting data.

By following this prompt, you will create the MongoDB schemas for storing messages and notifications, optimized for real-time operations. The schemas are designed to support efficient querying, indexing strategies, and scalability considerations. Additionally, security and performance aspects are highlighted to ensure a robust and secure implementation.
