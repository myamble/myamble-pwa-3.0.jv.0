**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **Import Dependencies**: Import the required dependencies, including Express.js, express-validator for input validation, the ClickHouse client library, authentication middleware functions, and the `generateReport` utility function.

2. **Initialize ClickHouse Client**: Create a new instance of the ClickHouse client with the appropriate connection configuration.

3. **Endpoint: Generate Survey Report**:
   - Route: `POST /analytics/reports`
   - Authentication: Requires a valid JWT token and the `VIEW_ANALYTICS` permission.
   - Input Validation: Validates the `surveyId` (UUID) and `reportConfig` (object) using express-validator.
   - Request Body: `{ surveyId: string, reportConfig: object }`
   - Functionality:
     - Fetches the raw survey response data from the `survey_analytics` table for the specified `surveyId`.
     - Fetches the pre-aggregated analytics summary from the `survey_analytics_summary` materialized view for the specified `surveyId`.
     - Calls the `generateReport` utility function, passing the survey data, analytics summary, and the `reportConfig` object.
     - The `generateReport` function should generate a comprehensive report in PDF format based on the provided data and configuration.
   - Response: Sends the generated PDF report as a file attachment with the appropriate headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`).

4. **Error Handling**: The endpoint includes error handling and logging for potential failures during data fetching or report generation.

**Considerations:**

- **Report Configuration**: The `reportConfig` object should allow users to customize the report's content, layout, and formatting. This could include options for selecting specific sections, charts, or visualizations to include, as well as styling and branding options.

- **Report Generation Utility**: The `generateReport` utility function should be implemented separately, potentially leveraging a dedicated reporting library or framework. This function should handle the logic for generating the report based on the provided data and configuration.

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.

- **Permissions**: Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can generate reports.

- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently generated reports or computationally expensive report generation tasks to improve performance.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for the report generation endpoint to track performance, errors, and potential issues.

- **Scalability**: As the volume of survey data and report generation requests increases, you may need to implement scalability measures, such as load balancing or asynchronous report generation with queuing mechanisms.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and provide meaningful error messages to users in case of failures during report generation.

- **Documentation**: Document the API endpoint, including input parameters, expected responses, and any specific requirements or constraints related to report generation.

By following this prompt, you can implement a secure and configurable API endpoint for generating comprehensive reports based on survey data and analytics stored in ClickHouse. The generated reports can provide valuable insights and summaries to social workers and researchers, enhancing the overall functionality of the Social Work Survey Application.
