**Prompt Explanation:**

1. **Survey Analytics Table**: This table stores the raw survey response data, including the survey ID, participant ID, question ID, answer, and timestamp. The `MergeTree` engine is used for efficient storage and querying of large datasets.

2. **Indexes**: To improve query performance, we create two indexes on the `survey_id` and `participant_id` columns using the `minmax` index type. The `GRANULARITY` setting controls the index granularity, which can be adjusted based on the data volume and query patterns.

3. **Partitioning**: The table is partitioned by month (`toYYYYMM(timestamp)`) to improve query performance and data organization. Partitioning allows ClickHouse to skip irrelevant data partitions during queries, reducing the amount of data to be scanned.

4. **Materialized View**: To support efficient analytical queries, we create a materialized view `survey_analytics_summary` that pre-aggregates the data by survey ID, question ID, and answer. This view is partitioned by month and replicated across multiple nodes for high availability and fault tolerance.

**Considerations:**

- **Data Volume**: ClickHouse is designed to handle large volumes of analytical data efficiently. As the survey response data grows, you may need to adjust the partitioning strategy, indexing, and storage settings for optimal performance.

- **Query Patterns**: The schema design should be tailored to the specific query patterns and analytical requirements of the application. Additional materialized views or aggregations may be needed to support complex queries or real-time reporting.

- **Data Retention**: Implement a data retention policy to manage the growth of the analytics data over time. Older data can be archived or purged based on the application's requirements.

- **Security**: Implement appropriate access controls and data encryption measures to protect the sensitive survey response data stored in ClickHouse.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Monitor the ClickHouse cluster for performance, disk usage, and potential issues. Regularly maintain the cluster by performing tasks such as merging partitions, optimizing tables, and updating configurations as needed.

By following this schema design, the Social Work Survey Application can efficiently store and query large volumes of survey response data for advanced analytics and reporting purposes.
