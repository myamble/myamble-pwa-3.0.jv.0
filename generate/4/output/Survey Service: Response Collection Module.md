**Prompt**

Develop the module for collecting and storing survey responses securely, following best practices for input validation, error handling, and data integrity.

**Requirements**

1. **Submit Response Endpoint**:
   - Implement an endpoint that allows authenticated participants to submit their responses to a specific survey.
   - Validate the input data, ensuring that the `answers` field is a non-empty array.
   - Store the response data in the `responses` table, including the survey ID, participant ID, and the actual answers.
   - Publish an event to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) to notify other services about the new response.
   - Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

2. **Retrieve Responses Endpoint**:
   - Implement an endpoint that allows authorized users (e.g., social workers, administrators) to retrieve all responses for a specific survey.
   - Implement role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can access this endpoint.
   - Return the response data, including the response ID, participant ID, answers, and the creation timestamp.
   - Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

**Implementation**

1. **Submit Response Endpoint**:
   - The endpoint is defined as `POST /api/surveys/:surveyId/responses`.
   - The `authenticateToken` middleware is used to ensure that only authenticated users can access the endpoint.
   - The `checkPermission('RESPOND_TO_SURVEY')` middleware is used to ensure that only participants are allowed to submit responses.
   - The `express-validator` library is used to validate the input data, ensuring that the `answers` field is a non-empty array.
   - If the input validation fails, a 400 Bad Request response is returned with the validation errors.
   - If the input is valid, the response data is stored in the `responses` table using the `Response.create` method from Sequelize.
   - After storing the response, an event is published to a message queue using the `publishEvent` function, notifying other services about the new response.
   - A 201 Created response is returned with the response ID and a success message.
   - Proper error handling and logging are implemented using `try/catch` blocks and `console.error`.

2. **Retrieve Responses Endpoint**:
   - The endpoint is defined as `GET /api/surveys/:surveyId/responses`.
   - The `authenticateToken` middleware is used to ensure that only authenticated users can access the endpoint.
   - The `checkPermission('VIEW_ANALYTICS')` middleware is used to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., social workers, administrators) can retrieve survey responses.
   - The `Response.findAll` method from Sequelize is used to retrieve all responses for the specified survey ID, including the response ID, participant ID, answers, and creation timestamp.
   - The retrieved responses are returned as a JSON response.
   - Proper error handling and logging are implemented using `try/catch` blocks and `console.error`.

**Best Practices and Considerations**

- **Input Validation**: The `express-validator` library is used to validate the input data, ensuring that the `answers` field is a non-empty array. This helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.

- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented using `try/catch` blocks and appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages are returned to the client. Errors are also logged using `console.error` for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: The `checkPermission` middleware is used to implement role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access the respective endpoints.

- **Data Integrity**: The response data is stored in the `responses` table using the `Response.create` method from Sequelize, ensuring data integrity and consistency with the database schema.

- **Event Publishing**: After storing a new response, an event is published to a message queue using the `publishEvent` function. This allows other services to be notified about the new response and take appropriate actions (e.g., triggering analytics, sending notifications).

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code follows the principle of separation of concerns by using middleware functions for authentication, authorization, and input validation, keeping the route handlers focused on the core functionality.

- **Documentation**: The code is well-documented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each endpoint, as well as the expected input and output formats.

**Suggested Libraries and Tools**

- Express.js (for building the API endpoints)
- express-validator (for input validation)
- Sequelize (for interacting with the PostgreSQL database)
- RabbitMQ (or any other message queue system)
- Winston (for logging)

By following this implementation, you will have a secure and robust module for collecting and retrieving survey responses, adhering to best practices for input validation, error handling, role-based access control, and data integrity.
